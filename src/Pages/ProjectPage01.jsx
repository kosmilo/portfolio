                            <i>Bad Trip</i> is a Subway Surfers -style actions runner spiced with sick music and surfing. The game is
                            currently in development, and we plan on releasing it for Android.

                            I have worked on a handfull of things in the project, from player movement to the in-game shop, though I'd say
                            my biggest contributions have been integrading Unity's Addressables to the project and handling additive scene
                            loading to reduce load times.
                        </p>

                            I joined midway through the development, and I'm currently the only programmer on the team. Which, I suppose,
                            also makes me the lead programmer by techicality. ðŸ¤”

                            information on our current progress as well as other people developing the game.
